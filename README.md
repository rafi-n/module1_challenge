# HIVE A Canadian Crypto Miner

## Overview and Origin
Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd, located in Vancouver, BC, got its start back in 1987 as Leeta Gold Corp, when it was incorporated. Leeta combined with Genesis Mining Ltd, a leading crypto miner at the time and changed its name in September 2017, to more closely match its current operations. 

> Genesis Mining, the world's leading hashpower provider with over 700,000 customers, has entered into an exclusive partnership with HIVE to provide and operate up to five blockchain Data Centres - [newswire]

Hive was founded by investors who saw the emerging capabilities of cryptocurrency and the need for high performance computation to get the job done. Initially, Hive was run by interim CEO Harry Pokrandt and select appointees to the board. The company is currently lead by Chairman Frank Holmes and CEO Aydin Kilic.
